= Tips for using \Rainbows! with Sandbox installation tools

Most {tips for unicorn}[https://yhbt.net/unicorn/Sandbox.html]
for Bundler and Isolate apply to \Rainbows! as well.

== TLDR (Bundler)

You need to add "rainbows" to your Gemfile for Bundler and start
\Rainbows! with:

	bundle exec rainbows ...

== TLDR (Isolate)

Isolate "rainbows" and execute the "rainbows" launcher in your isolated
GEM_PATH:

	$APP_ROOT/tmp/ruby-1.9/bin/rainbows ...

== Explanation

Due to the variety of potential dependencies, \Rainbows! lazy loads many
of its internals, often after the application itself is loaded.  This
results in more potential to interact badly with sandbox tools that
modify the gem environment.
