# Warning: The "timeout" directive in unicorn is far more dangerous
# in Rainbows!, since ALL requests running on a process will be lost
# on worker death, not just one.  Instead, handle application-level
# timeouts yourself: https://yhbt.net/unicorn/Application_Timeouts.html

  # Allows overriding the +klass+ where the +copy_stream+ method is
  # used to do efficient copying of regular files, pipes, and sockets.
  #
  # This is only used with multi-threaded concurrency models:
  #
  # * ThreadSpawn
  # * ThreadPool
  # * WriterThreadSpawn
  # * WriterThreadPool
  # * XEpollThreadSpawn
  # * XEpollThreadPool
  #
  # Due to existing {bugs}[http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/search?q=copy_stream]
  # in the Ruby IO.copy_stream implementation, \Rainbows! uses the
  # "sendfile" RubyGem that instead of copy_stream to transfer regular files
  # to clients.  The "sendfile" RubyGem also supports more operating systems,
  # and works with more concurrency models.
  #
  # Recent Linux 2.6 users may override this with "IO::Splice" from the
  # "io_splice" RubyGem:
  #
  #   require "io/splice"
  #   Rainbows! do
  #     copy_stream IO::Splice
  #   end
  #
  # Keep in mind that splice(2) itself is a relatively new system call
  # and has been buggy in many older Linux kernels.  If you're proxying
  # the output of sockets to the client, be sure to use "io_splice"
  # 4.1.1 or later to avoid stalling responses.
  #
  # Default: IO on Ruby 1.9+, false otherwise
